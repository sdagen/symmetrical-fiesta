    % Storage-endurance conclusions, post-resolution (ADR-030 finding,
    % ADR-032 resolution). The requirements owner excluded consumables
    % from the SR-GS-011 mass budget and the stores were resized to 72 h
    % at each variant's nominal rate; these tests baseline the resolved
    % state. The finding-era baselines (6.41/4.66/5.44 h, asserting
    % endurance < 72) were retired consciously by the ADR-032 rework -
    % exactly the retirement mechanism they were built with.
